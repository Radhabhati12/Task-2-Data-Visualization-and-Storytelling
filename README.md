This project uses the Adidas Sales dataset to create an interactive and insightful dashboard. The dashboard highlights key sales trends and performance metrics. It allows users to analyze sales and profit across different regions, cities, and products, compare online vs. retail performance, and monitor time-based trends. The dashboard helps stakeholders make informed business decisions by providing a clear visual summary of Adidasâ€™s sales operations.
Through interactive visuals and filters, users can:
Track sales performance by region, state, and city to identify high- and low-performing areas.
Analyze product-wise performance by comparing units sold, revenue, and profit across different Adidas products.
Compare online vs. retail sales methods to see which sales channel is more effective in different locations or for specific products.
Drill down into individual retailer performance, making it easier for decision-makers to identify strengths and weaknesses across the sales network.
